<b><u>Storage</b></u>
</center>
<b>Storage</b> refers to holding information somewhere. RAM, Random Access Memory, is short-term 
memory. It is volatile memory because the memory is automatically erased when the power is 
turned off of interrupted. The RAM memory is located inside the computer case on the 
motherboard. A motherboard is not the keyboard. The keyboard is what you type with. A 
motherboard holds RAM memory, electronic circuits and other computer parts including the central 
processing unit. ROM, Read Only Memory, is not volatile meaning the memory is still there when 
power is interrupted or turned off. When the computer is turned back on again, ROM memory is 
still in storage on the internal hard disk.
